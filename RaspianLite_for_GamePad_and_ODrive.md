# Raspberry Pi Lite For Motor Controller

Here we attempt creating a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W raspian setup that will work with Odrive and bluetooth gamepad as controller.

For fastest boot the controller should not have anything else running that the minimum services.
Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W will boot in approximately 20 secs from power on and be able to have bluetooth device connected. 

Networking over wireless is not needed and we will use point to point ethernet over serial to connect to second raspberry. Second raspberry will have many more interfaces enabled but  boot will take longer: wireless, i2s sensors, camera and lights etc.

## SD card
1) Download Raspian Imager https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/imager/imager_latest.exe
2) Use Raspberry Pi OS Lite 64bit
3) Set, ssh, wifi, username, password, hostname in the imager settings.
4) Expand the user/2nd partition

## Configuration
If you can not download from several websites check that your time is close to correct.
sudo date -s 2023.04.19-19:35

### General
```
sudo raspi-config
```
Set auto login, the interfaces you need

## Install Packages

### Basics
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```
### Bluetooth and Device Connections
For device connected to Odrive
https://python-evdev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
```
sudo pip3 install python-evdev
sudo pip3 install pyudev
```

### PySerial
```
sudo pip3 install pyserial```
```
To talk to odrive.

## ODrive Tool
```
sudo pip3 install --pre --upgrade odrive

sudo bash -c "curl https://cdn.odriverobotics.com/files/odrive-udev-rules.rules > /etc/udev/rules.d/91-odrive.rules"
sudo bash -c "udevadm control --reload-rules"
sudo bash -c "udevadm trigger" 
```

Also download latest firmware for your odrive as shown here. https://docs.odriverobotics.com/releases/firmware
E.g. for Odrive V3.6 with 56V capacitors https://odrive-cdn.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/releases/firmware/CYC5jqJ8C3fX8EsJrgmPryR3_y9xgtR-zNw5jgeSUKk/firmware.elf
Once we disable wireless you can no longer download firmware.

Ubuntu, Raspbian: If you canâ€™t invoke odrivetool at this point, try adding ~/.local/bin to your $PATH (see related bug). This is done for example by running nano ~/.bashrc, scrolling to the bottom, pasting export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin, and then saving and closing, and close and reopen the terminal window.

### Realtime Clock

### PPP
We will attempt local network over serial RX/TX. Make sure serial console is disabled but serial is enabled for interfaces.

```
sudo apt-get install ppp
```

````
sudo raspi-config
```
Select option 5, "Interfacing Options"
Select option P6, "Serial" 
Select "No" to login shell and "Yes" to enabling serial port

Test serial speed with loop back between GPIO 24 and GPIO 15. Direct wire or 500-700 Ohm resistor.

Maybe '''sudo bash -c "echo 'init_uart_clock=64000000' >> /boot/config.txt"'''

For Pi 3 and Pi 0 W ONLY, decide whether to use the PL011 (which means Bluetooth will be degraded or nonfunctional) or miniUART (your serial connection may not work great but Bluetooth still will work). I have not tested this setup using miniUART, but I assume it would work OK. For PL011, you need to enable one of the device tree overlays that frees PL011 from Bluetooth use e.g. miniuart-bt and disable-bt as described in /boot/overlays/README

It might be necessary: to enable_uart=1 in /boot/config.txt

With sudo nano /boot/cmdline.txt remove the word phase "console=serial0,115200" or "console=ttyAMA0,115200"

Content of /etc/rc.local on server should be:
```
echo "Starting pppd..."

### Speed up
On ODrive controlling device only

Disable hardware components we dont need:
```
sudo nano /boot/config.txt
```
Specifically
```
# Disable Audio
dtparam=audio=off

# Disable Splash Screen
disable_splash=1
# Disable boot delay, can no longer actiavte debug
boot_delay=0
# Overclock
force_turbo=1
[all]
# Don't need wifi
dtoverlay=disable-wifi
```
Now make boot quiet

```
sudo nano /boot/cmdline.txt
```
add ```loglevel=5 quiet``` after ```console=tty1```
add ```logo.nologo vt.global_cursor_default=0``` after ```rootwait```
change ```fsck.mode=skip```

Check out timing with

```
systemd-analyze # This shows kerne, user space and services.
systemd-analyze critical-chain # Shows dependencies
systemd-analyze blame # Each item
```

### Speed up by disabling services

Consider removing the following services

#### Verified to work

TODO Should look into systemd-timesyncd.service because don't care about time ```sudo systemctl disable systemd-timesyncd.service```
Should look into fschk-root as we dont need system to check drives
Should look into remount fs as we dont need access to boot device once verything is running

```
# Configure once, then leave as is
sudo systemctl disable raspi-config.service
# Run same program, will not need to adjust to programs booting by user
sudo systemctl disable dphys-swapfile.service 
# Don't care about keyboard
sudo systemctl disable keyboard-setup.service
# Will not want to flash EEPROM
sudo systemctl disable rpi-eeprom-update.service
# 3.0 Kernel 10.8 User **6.2** Target reached
# Don't need network at least no the items related to wlan0 and eth0
sudo systemctl disable NetworkManager.service
sudo systemctl disable wpa_supplicant.service
sudo systemctl disable ModemManager.service
# 3.0 Kernel 11.3 User **5.4** Target reached 
# Don't care about printing
sudo systemctl disable cups.service
sudo systemctl disable cups-browsed.service
# 2.9 Kernel 11.5 User **5.0** Target reached 
```

#### Working on

e2scrub_reap.service cleans up unused space on ext4 file systems. It is not essential.
glamor-test.service graphics driver for XWindows
user@1000.service  responsible for managing user-level services for a specific user with UID (User ID) of 1000. Is not essential
systemctl disable avahi-daemon.service that provides network service discovery on local networks, not essential but likely bluetooth needs it
modprobe@drm.service loads the drm (Direct Rendering Manager) kernel module during system startup, not sure if any additions are loeaded 

## Autologin from windows/max/linux to Raspian

On client, e.g. Windows Powershell
```
ssh-keygen
```
On Raspberry Pi:
```
sudo nano .ssh/authorized_keys
```
copy content of id_rsa.pub into file

## Remove CR from files
When you copy paste from windows into ssh terminal, you might insert CR-LF as line terminator. You only want LF. You can strip them in text files with:
```
sed 's/\r$//' in.txt > out.txt
```

## Bluetooth

To permanently install devices you need to manually pair and trust them 

```
bluetoothctl 
power on
pairable on
scan on
```

Wait for any pairing keys and enter them on the bluetooth device if prompted e.g.:
```
pair 00:00:00:33:9B:58
trust 00:00:00:33:9B:58
connect 00:00:00:33:9B:58
```

If you modify wireless connection or management, it might be necessary to repair the device.
